Participation in the Women4Cyber CyberDrill (Operation Ironshield), powered by CYBER RANGES, within the Team W4C002, Sept. 2025.

Results : Third place (Bronze), over 60 teams and +500 participants.

A CyberDrill simulates real-world cyber incidents in a structured, immersive environment. This training experience was about collaborative decision-making, strategic thinking, and applying technical skills under pressure.

The scenario served as a guide on how to:
- Perform the detection and analysis phase of an incidence response
- Assess security analysts' ability to analyse logs to detect attacks carried out against a corporate network.

The scenario served as a challenge on how to review various log sources of different machines to identify the attack carried out on the corporate network.

Tools : ELK, Wazuh, Arkime, Velociraptor.
